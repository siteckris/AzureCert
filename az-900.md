### Defining Identity, authentication and authorization
  - Identity: Who or what a person or object claims to be
	  - Physical world: Passport, Drivers license, hospital Identity
	  - Digital world: AD object, software license, Email ID
  - Authentication: the process of validation an identity proof
	  - Physical world: House key, certificate of authenticity, Safety deposit box password
	  - Digital world:SSH key, SSL Certificate, Email account Password
  - Authorization: the process of calidation what the identity can do. This is the roles you get
	  - Physical world: Event ticket - specific time and space. Gate specific key, key card with specific doors entry
	  - Digital world: Application secrets, Shared access signature token, Key card

### Security and Governance
Security = Restrict access to only those that need it
Governance =  The level of access a person have, what they can do with it and how they can do it

### Azure Active Directory / Azure AD
  - Authenticate and Authorize
  - Controls access
  - Service Principle - AAD aplications
  - Managed identity - Azure Resources. Use managed identity to grans a web app access to a VM

Azure AD is the light AD service, the full monty is called Acure AD Domain Services.
- User replica sets
- Uses managed domains
- Supports onprem integration and legacy authentication

Authentication methods
 - Single Sign-on (SSO)
   - use the ID used to logon to your computer
 - Methods
   - Password Hash Syncronization. Matches the password hash
   - Pass-through authentication. Uses authentication provider
 - MFA (Azure AD is two-factor, only premium subscription)
   - Something you know: username/password
   - Something you have: Mobile device, card or authenticator
   - something you are: Fingerprint, biometrics
 - Passwordless
   - FIDO2 security key (sometimes 2)
   - Microsoft Authenticator app
   - Text message/sms
   - Temp password pass. Often used to restore access
   - Certificate
   - Windows Helo for business

Azure AD conditional access
  - Uses signals to make decisions what policies to apply
    - Could be signals about where you are logging on from or what device og patchlevel

RBAC
  - Authorize users based on their role
  - Using 3 elements
    - Security Principal: (user, group, app or managed principal) 
    - Role: what persmission do they get
    - Scope: Where are they applied. Roles are enherited

Zero-trust
  - Asume systems are compromised
  - Use MFA
  - Use Conditional Access - requiers application to be ready/designed for it

Defence in depth 
  - Everything else but perimiter
  - Layered security


### Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  - Protects Azure resources, other clouds and on-prem
  - Features
    - Security
    - Regulatory compliance
    - Workload protection
  - Constantly monitors and accesses





### Defence in depth - layered defence
7 layers
  - Physical security
  - Identity and Access
  - Perimiter
  - Network
  - Compute
  - Application
  - Data

  ### Cloud service types
  - IaaS: Computers, network, storage ect. Great control and responsibility. Ex: Virt server
  - PaaS: Infrastructure, OS, Middleware. Reduces management burden. Ex: Azure App services
  - SaaS: Infrastructure, Middleware and application provided by cloud. Least responcibility. Most used. Ex. Onedrive or office365
  - Faas:

  ### Core Architecture and services
  Breakdown of regions
  Geography -> Region -> AZ -> Datacenters
  - Azure Geography
    - Typical geo region like US or EU
  - Region. 
    - Each directly connected to another region = region pair. 
    - Will auto failover to region pair in case of disaster, but you need to have designed your solution to benefit from it
    - Region pairs will never update at the same time
    - Usually at least 300miles apart
  - AZ
    - Consist of one or more datacenters
    - Unique physical lications within a region
  - Datacenters
    - At least 2 for each region
      - Zonal services (Like VM's) are specific for that AZ, you need to deploy them
      - Zone-redundant (like Azure storage) Microsoft will replicate it to the AZ's
  - Sovereign region
    - Goverment regions - only US. Dedicated hardware and network
    - Germany - build for GDPR in germany, availible for EU and UK - run by T-systems
    - Shanghai - build for China, both to meet Chinese and US regulations

### Breakdown of resources
  - Resource and groups
    - Any entity you create in Azure (App, VM, DB .. ect) is a resource
    - Each resource is added to a Resource Group, that is a logical container to help management.
    - Resource groups can be tagged
    - Resource groups makes it easy to redeploy using ARM templates
    - Each resource or resource group is part of a specific Azure Subscription
  - Management Groups goes across subscription
    - The only thing you can put in a management group, is subscriptions and other management groups

### Breakdown of Compute and Network services
  - Compute types
    - A service that consume CPU or mem 
    - So it can be a VM, Container(ACI - Azure Container Instances) or Function
  - VM options
    - Both Linux and Microsoft
    - Availability sets: Consist of Fault domains and Update domains
      - Fault domain: Logical representation of physical server hardware. Could be a Foodprint in a DC. Protects against fault in a hardware rack
      - Update domain: Logical representation of virtual server, grouping for updates so servers wont be updated and reboot untill one of the other update domains are available
    - VMSS - Virtual Machine Scale sets. A auto-scaling group for VM's
    - Azure Virtual Desktop - Remote desktop service

#### Requiered resources for VM's in Azure
  - Virtual network
  - Virtuel maskine config file
  - Public IP
  - Network Security Group
  - Network Interface
  - SSHkey - if keybased Linux
  - OS disk

#### Application hosting options
  - Azure app service
    - Load Balancer -> Frontend (reverse proxy) -> one or many VM's running the app (Inside an App Service Plan)
    - You can run multiple Apps on the same App Service Plan - but all the VM's will be identical

#### Virtual Networks
  - Azure Virtual Network 10.0.0.0/16
    - Subnet A 10.0.1.0/24 (Web tier - presentation)
    - Subnet B 10.0.2.0/24 (Middle tier - worker)
    - subnet C 10.0.3.0/24 (Data tier - DB)
  - Connect different Virtual Networks through Azure Network Peering
    - Only routes over Microsofts Private Network - ikke on internet and not encrypted
    - Can peer on same region or across different regions using Global Virtual Network Peering
  - DNS Zones
    - Public zones - internet facing
    - Private zones - used for Azure VNets
  - VPN Gateway
    - Secure connectivity between Azure VNets and other networks
      - VNet to VNet
      - Site to Site
      - Point to site (Device to site/VNet)
    - Currently limited to 1.25 Gbits pr. s
  - Azure Expressroute (MS calls it a circuit)
    - Connect to Onprem or other DC
    - 10 Gbps
    - Dedicated fiber
    - Typically connected through a thirdparty provider
  
  #### Public and private endpoints
  - Public endpoint: Public IP adress reachable over the internet
  - Private endpoint: IP only reachable over a private network

  #### Storage Services
  - Blob Storage
    - Unstructured files
    - Stored in containers(Buckets/folders)
    - Types:
      - Block blobs: (Files used by applications)
      - Append blobs: Optimiced for append options - like logfiles
      - Page blobs: Stores VHD's or other virtuel disks used by virtual mashines
  - Azure Disks
    - Stores disk used in Azure VMs
    - Either as Spinning or Solid state disk
    - Also where you create persisten datadisks for VMs
  - Azure files
    - SMB based file storage
    - Azure filesync - sync files to local folder
  - Storage Tiers
    - Hot: access often and more costly
    - Cool: archive date you want to store for a long time, but not access often
      - Stored for at least 30 days
    - Archive: Must be stored for at least 180 days
      - Accesstime can be 16 hours

  ### Random
  BCDR = Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (plan or guide)

  Multi AZ = good for fault tolorance but not for Disaster
  But if you need Disaster resiliency, you need to go with multi region
